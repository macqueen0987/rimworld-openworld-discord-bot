# rimworld-openworld-discord-bot
Discord bot that helps taking care of rimworld openworld mod server.
I'll try to add more features in the future


## Open World Mods page

## Open World mod server file github

https://github.com/TastyLollipop/OpenWorld


This has nothing to do with the openworld mod developer, I am making for my own use.

## List of commands - most of it's commands are same with server console

```
shutdown : shutdowns this bot   
reload : reloads mods and whitelists   
status : get server status   
command : sends command to the server console   
console : sends command directly to server file directory   
download : dowloads mod using steamcmd   
delete : deletes mods   
notify : notifies user   
broadcast : broadcast message   
```
