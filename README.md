# rimworld-openworld-discord-bot
Discord bot that helps taking care of rimworld openworld mod server.
I'll try to add more features in the future

## Open World mod server file github

This has nothing to do with the openworld mod developer, I am making for my own use.

## List of commands - most of it's commands are same with server console
Helps are written as thinking the prefix is ! as default    
[] <- these are places for parameters in it. Ex) !s [server commands] -> !s help
```
!hi        : answers back to you
!ping      : show ping
!uptime    : show how long the bot has been running

---Under this line requires discord server moderator commands---
!shutdown                         : shutdowns this bot
!s [some command]                 : sends command to screen which openworld server is running
!reload                           : reloads mods and whitelists   
!status                           : get server status   
!start                            : starts the openworld server
!exit                             : shutdowns the openworld server
!console [some command]           : sends command directly to server file directory   
!download [mod id]                : dowloads mod using steamcmd. add "required" in between to download it at Mods folder
